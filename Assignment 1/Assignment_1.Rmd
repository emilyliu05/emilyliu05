## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)

#year <- 2017
each_year <- 2017:2020
pge_elec <- NULL

for(year in each_year) {

quarters <- 1:4
type <- "Electric"

for(quarter in quarters) {
  
  filename <- 
    paste0(
      "pge/PGE_",
      year,
      "_Q",
      quarter,
      "_",
      type,
      "UsageByZip.csv"
    )

  print(filename)
  
  temp <- read_csv(filename)
  
  pge_elec <- rbind(pge_elec,temp)
  # Note rbind requires field names to be consistent for every new thing that you add.

  saveRDS(pge_elec, "pge_elec.rds")
}
print(pge_elec)
}

```
```{r}
each_year <- 2017:2020
pge_gas <- NULL

for(year in each_year) {

quarters <- 1:4
type <- "Gas"

for(quarter in quarters) {
  
  filename <- 
    paste0(
      "pge/PGE_",
      year,
      "_Q",
      quarter,
      "_",
      type,
      "UsageByZip.csv"
    )

  print(filename)
  
  temp <- read_csv(filename)
  
  pge_gas <- rbind(pge_gas,temp)
  # Note rbind requires field names to be consistent for every new thing that you add.

  saveRDS(pge_gas, "pge_gas.rds")
}
print(pge_gas)
}

```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}

pge_filter_comm_e <- 
  filter(
    pge_elec,
    CUSTOMERCLASS %in% 
      c(
        "Elec- Commercial"
      )
  )
pge_filter_res_e <- 
  filter(
    pge_elec,
    CUSTOMERCLASS %in% 
      c(
        "Elec- Residential"
      )
  )

pge_filter_comm_g <- 
  filter(
    pge_gas,
    CUSTOMERCLASS %in% 
      c(
        "Gas- Commercial"
      )
  )

pge_filter_res_g <- 
  filter(
    pge_gas,
    CUSTOMERCLASS %in% 
      c(
        "Gas- Residential"
      )
  )
pge_select_comm_e <- 
    select(
    pge_filter_comm_e,
    -c(ZIPCODE, COMBINED)
    )
pge_select_res_e <- 
   select(
    pge_filter_res_e,
    -c(ZIPCODE, COMBINED)
  )
pge_select_comm_g <- 
    select(
    pge_filter_comm_g,
    -c(ZIPCODE, COMBINED)
    )
pge_select_res_g <- 
    select(
    pge_filter_res_g,
    -c(ZIPCODE, COMBINED)
    )
```

```{r}
pge_group_res_e <-
  group_by(
    pge_select_res_e,
    MONTH,
    CUSTOMERCLASS
  )

pge_group_comm_e <-
  group_by(
    pge_select_comm_e,
    MONTH,
    CUSTOMERCLASS
  )

pge_group_res_g <-
  group_by(
    pge_select_res_g,
    MONTH,
    CUSTOMERCLASS
  )

pge_group_comm_g <-
  group_by(
    pge_select_comm_g,
    MONTH,
    CUSTOMERCLASS
  )

pge_summarize_res_e <-
  summarize(
    pge_group_res_e,
    TOTALBTU = 
      sum(
        TOTALKWH * 3.412, 
        na.rm = T
      )
  )

pge_summarize_comm_e <-
  summarize(
    pge_group_comm_e,
    TOTALkBTU = 
      sum(
        TOTALKWH * 3.412, 
        na.rm = T
      )
  )

pge_summarize_res_g <-
  summarize(
    pge_group_res_g,
    TOTALkBTU = 
      sum(
        TOTALTHM * 99.976, 
        na.rm = T
      )
  )

pge_summarize_comm_g <-
  summarize(
    pge_group_comm_g,
    TOTALkBTU = 
      sum(
        TOTALTHM * 99.976, 
        na.rm = T
      )
  )
```

```{r}
pge_final_elec <-
  pge_elec %>% 
  filter(
    CUSTOMERCLASS %in% 
      c(
        "Elec- Residential",
        "Elec- Commercial"
      )
  ) %>% 
  select(
    -c(YEAR, COMBINED, AVERAGEKWH)
  ) %>% 
  group_by(MONTH, CUSTOMERCLASS) %>% 
  summarize(
    TOTALKWH = 
      sum(
        TOTALKWH, 
        na.rm = T
      ),
    TOTALCUSTOMERS =
      sum(
        TOTALCUSTOMERS,
        na.rm = T
      )
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    AVERAGEKWH =
      TOTALKWH/TOTALCUSTOMERS
  )
pge_final
```
```{r}

pge_chart <-
  pge_final %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(
    aes(
      x = MONTH %>% factor(),
      y = TOTALKWH,
      fill = CUSTOMERCLASS
    ),
    stat = "identity",
    position = "stack"
  ) +
  labs(
    x = "Month",
    y = "kWh",
    title = "PG&E Territory Monthly Electricity Usage", year,
    fill = "Electricity Type"
  )
pge_chart
```

```{r}
#pge_chart %>% ggplotly()

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
